neutrino_lathe,SHIP,"Extremely rare, the product of Neutrino over-engineering. Sometime being mentioned as a battlecruiser, or more appropriately, a mini-battleship, this oversized large cruiser is designed to hunt down other cruiser-size targets with its superiors fire power and defense capability. An oversized phase skimmer provided it surprising burst maneuverability.

An aggressive design initiated before the collapse. The Lathe class is a proofs-of-concept for large convoy escort ship design, which intents be used in long-distance escort missions that the ship replacement is not an option. As a superior all-round built, the Lathe class have a really high survivability on the field. But its high maintain requirement limited its availability a lot.

Although its main front facing armament is designed to counter ship have equal or larger size in one on one combat, when facing multiple incoming small threats, a single Lathe class large cruiser is able to neutralize several of them swiftly before she get flanked and surrounded.

Designed for drone maintenance in asteroid belt mining operations, this carrier variant of Pile-driver class put durability and serviceability at priority one to withstand the hazardous environment in long period of time. Because of this, it was often seen in prolonged low-intensity conflict serve as a light carrier in these days.

The drone maintenance module used to be market under the name of Mobile Dronehive, and it really attracted a lot of unwanted attention from the authorities. Since it was built for maintaining Polarity container drones, a general complaint from the pilots is that the flight deck design lacks ergonomics.

Despite the missile body is somehow bulky, by employing an smart guiding AI and swith back to an more efficiency conventional thruster it can still track on target nimbly in a reasonable range. Though its launcher already sacrificed some rack capacity, the autoloader still took up too much under deck room and make this weapons system somehow hard to set up.

neutrino_sapper,WEAPON,"An eight shot EMP rocket launcher, with the rockets specially designed to slow down into a compact group to act as impromptu EMP mines.

Can easily disable subsystems and destroy target at the same time. Maybe a little overkilled, but this weapon is a belt and braces measure you want to have when you needs to disable a target completely for sure.

The Thundernail electrostatic rocket is a simple design that use high density ultracapacitor to stores electrons and release them when impact. In addition to a significant EMP effect, this discharging will release a high current pass through armor plates, vaporize and ionize them, resulting a series of internal explosion that can break them effectively.

neutrino_bane,WEAPON,"A quad pulsed boson accelerator that uses a unique spiralized containment field to achieve results that are barely understood. While its main usage is bring on continuous suppress fire to shielded, fast, or small vessels, a recently targeting software upgrade enable the capacity to tracking incoming missiles as secondly targets. Had small chance to deal extra damage on hit.

AKA ""Strom Blaster"". Despite part of the energy effective was traded in to gain a better range, this weapon still have the capacity to unleash an unremitting fire barrage for a long time that continuous bring in hard pressure on enemy shield.

The Baneful Boson Blaster is the answer from Neutrino to the high quality shields became a standard-issue equipment for recently ship designs, even though the initial goal of this project was an anti-fighter weapon. Neutrino claimed that all weapons in Baneful Boson Blaster series could sometimes cause much greater destruction on hit, and that was observed afield. But any experienced captains are supposed to know these kind of ""lucky shots"" are not reliable, especially when their judgment will matter the difference between live and death.

neutrino_misery,WEAPON,"A dual spiralize pulsed boson accelerator that offers good range and effective damage. Designed for continuous suppress on shield and occasionally some auxiliary PD assist. Had small chance to deal extra damage on hit.

A miniaturized Baneful Boson Blaster that intended to fit an all-round fire support role. But restricted by its low penetrating power, it mostly be used as an anti-fighter weapon as its original design, besides from the shield pressuring role.
